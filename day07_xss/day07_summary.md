# Day 7 â€“ Manual & Automated XSS Testing

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Understand basic XSS vulnerability types
- Perform manual payload testing on DVWA
- Use XSStrike for automated XSS detection

## ðŸ”§ Activities
- Ran XSS reflected tests manually on DVWA (Low security)
- Tested payloads like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
- Verified alerts and script execution
- Installed and ran XSStrike to scan for reflected XSS

- Reflected XSS is easily exploitable if inputs are not sanitized
- Automated tools like XSStrike aid fast scanning
- Manual validation is still important when tools report no reflection
